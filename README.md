## Overview


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- google fonts




### What I learned
I learnt how to use margin- auto to center my box in another,
I learnt how to use boreder-radius to curve the corners of my box,
how to use the flex attribute better



### Continued development

I would like to learn more about box models so i can be able to use them better in the future.
### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://w3schools.com) - This helped me to get solutions to some of the problems i experienced such as adding a favicon . I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.google/fonts.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me get a nice font. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
